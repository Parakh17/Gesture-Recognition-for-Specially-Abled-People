    <h2>What is Sign Language ?</h2>
    <p>The Sign language is a visual language used by the people with the speech and hearing 
      disabilities for communication in their daily conversation activities. The goal of the project is 
      to come up with an innovative solution for the deaf and hard of hearing community and 
      develop an inclusive environment for them. The community is not able to express 
      themselves and feel excluded at moments. The goal is further motivated to overcome the 
      isolation and loneliness that is felt within the community. The main areas that are taken into 
      consideration are the communication gap, dealing with the emergency crisis followed by the 
      health and awareness section. For the communication section, an interface is made which 
      takes gestures as input and converts them to text. Handling the emergency situations is one 
      of the needs that need to be focussed upon in case of panic situations or crisis.</p>

            <h2 class="h-secondary center">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="center">The problem we are investigating is sign language recognition through unsupervised 
              feature learning. Being able to recognize sign language is an interesting computer 
              vision problem while simultaneously being extremely useful for deaf people to interact 
              with people who donâ€™t know how to understand American Sign Language (ASL). Our 
              project is to do sign language estimation using action detection.</p>

            <h2 class="h-secondary center">Objective</h2>
            <p class="center">The purpose of Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems is to provide an efficient and 
              accurate way to convert sign language into text or voice has aids for the hearing 
              impaired for example, or enabling very young children to interact with computers 
              (recognizing sign language), among others.</p>

            <h2 class="h-secondary center">Outcomes</h2>
            <p class="center">This project is built from the dataset collected by us through webcam and we processed 
              it to create the base of the project. In this we used mediapipe library that is efficient in 
              detecting pose and body movements and can be used to identify different poses. The 
              dataset collected is converted to numpy arrays which makes the training process faster 
              and also images deal well in numpy arrays.
              Afterwards we built a LSTM and Dense neural network for the final prediction of our 
              work. With success of the model real time predictions were done.</p>
